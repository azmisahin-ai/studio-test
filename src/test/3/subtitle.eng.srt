00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Once upon a time, a boy named Lalik lived in Colorful Town.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Lalik was the most cheerful and energetic child in the town.
He was a master of humor who always managed to make everyone around him laugh.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,000
One day, he decided to add color to the gray walls of the town.
Lalik brought colored paint bottles and brushes all over the town.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,000
They started to color the town square with their volunteer friends.
They decorated walls, benches and even trees with colorful paints.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,000
The town suddenly began to shine with vibrant colors.
The townspeople loved this colorful change.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Everyone thanked Lalik and gave him the title of "King of Color."
Lalik, smiling, said, "Life should not be gray, it should be colorful!" said.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,000
However, Uncle Grumpy, the gray-walled and monotonous house owner of the town, opposed the colorful change.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,000
He stood against Lalik and warned him to restore the town.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,000
But Color King Lalik was determined to change Uncle Grumpy's heart.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Lalik went to Uncle Grumpy's house and gave him a colorful painting as a gift.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Even though Uncle Grumpy looked at the painting with a resentful expression when he first saw it,

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,000
he realized that the colors colored the black-white world.
He started to smile slowly.

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,000
Eventually, everyone, including the townspeople and Uncle Grumpy, accepted the colorful change brought by the Color King Lalik.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,000
The town has become a place overflowing with all colours, not just grey.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
And Lalik went down in the town's history as the Color King.

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,000
With a smile on everyone's face and colorful walls everywhere,

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,000
everyone continued to live happily and peacefully in Colorful Town.
